## ADVANCED API 

Application Programming Interface (API) is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user intervention. API is a collection of software functions and procedures. In simple terms, API means a software code that can be accessed or executed. API is defined as a code that helps two different software’s to communicate and exchange data with each other.

APIs are of utility for businesses for seven broad purposes:

Access an application's data and logic and monetization potential of collected data
Use an application's functionality
Serve as a medium of communication between Microservices
Connecting ecosystems: C2B(Consumer to Business) and B2B(Business to Business)
Power integrations
New features for your business
Open new pathways for innovation and growth


API Architecture is the process of defining the methodology and processes for developing and running the API. They consist of a set of components and a description of their logic interaction.

Based on the architectural decisions of the API being developed, the operations and security teams form more specific technical requirements for the future of the API, its tiers, API lifecycle management, and most importantly, monetization.

APIs also have several benefits for building and managing microservices. With a focussed, value-driven API strategy, businesses can expose the functionality of microservices as products, thus creating the potential for internal and external business value.

After a difficult decision of shutting down its Public API Program, Netflix created a revolutionary microservices architecture. By linking its API with the microservices architecture, Netflix scaled into the cloud, became an internationally acclaimed OTT platform, and now serves millions of consumers over a range of disparate devices.

API Architecture, in particular, encompasses the following



1. API Gateway

This component deals with the delivery of security, caching, and orchestration specifics. Simply put, API Gateway serves as the single entry point into internal architecture. It has the following functions:

Delivers crucial load balancing capabilities and microservices partition.
Filter for incoming traffic from various devices — web, mobile, B2B, etc.
Entry point layer to expose other third-party APIs, microservices, virtual machines on the provider's application server.

2. API Portal

As the name suggests, this component serves as a portal between API Consumers and API Providers. It addresses the following:

API analysis

API documentation
Marketing APIs
Compatibility with web/mobile applications
Defining how they are exposed to internal, partner, and third-party developers

3. API Monitoring

API monitoring is not a core component of API Architecture, but it serves as an essential piece in the overall Infrastructure monitoring puzzle. If an application is running slow, you must first understand the root cause before you can correct it. The same applies to APIs. In order to know which API isn’t functioning well, you need to have a proper API monitoring system in place that monitor the health & performance of your API in real-time.


How to design an API Architecture?

Broadly speaking, APIs serve as the link among the technologies, the user, and the enterprise. 

Therefore, while designing a value-intensive API for your business model, the following crucial considerations should inform API design decisions in your enterprise.

Aligning the API design with your Business goals
Availability and Management of business resources
Use cases supported by your API

Defining the Target Audience or Users
Value creation, channels, and motivating developers to make use of the API

The value for end-users with the applications that use the API
