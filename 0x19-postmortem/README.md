Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred from May 10, 2023, at 9:00 AM (GMT) to May 11, 2023, at 6:00 PM (GMT).
Impact: The primary service affected was the company's web application, resulting in slow response times and intermittent service disruptions. Approximately 75% of users experienced difficulties accessing the application during this period.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a critical failure in the underlying database system. A hardware issue in the primary database server led to a cascading failure, resulting in degraded performance and eventual service interruptions.

Timeline:
- Issue Detected: May 10, 2023, at 9:15 AM (GMT). An engineer noticed an increase in database response times and reported the issue to the incident management team.
- Actions Taken: The incident management team immediately initiated an investigation, focusing on the database infrastructure and associated systems. Initial assumption: A network connectivity issue might have caused the degradation.
- Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths: Initial investigations primarily focused on the network components, including switches and routers, which led to delays in identifying the actual root cause.
- Escalation: The incident was escalated to the database operations team and the infrastructure team for further analysis and resolution.
- Incident Resolution: The issue was resolved by replacing the faulty hardware components in the primary database server and restoring the system to a stable state. This was followed by extensive testing to ensure the integrity of the database and its associated services.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a hardware failure in the primary database server, specifically related to the storage subsystem. This failure led to performance degradation and intermittent service disruptions. The issue was fixed by replacing the faulty hardware components, including the failed disk drives, and conducting comprehensive tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the database system.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:
- Enhance monitoring capabilities: Implement proactive monitoring for critical database components to detect early signs of hardware failures or performance degradation.
- Redundancy and failover mechanisms: Implement redundant hardware configurations and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability and minimize the impact of hardware failures.
- Regular hardware maintenance: Establish a schedule for regular hardware inspections, including disk drive health checks and firmware updates, to identify and mitigate potential issues before they cause significant disruptions.
- Incident response improvement: Review and enhance the incident response process, including clearer escalation paths and improved communication channels to expedite the resolution of critical issues.
- Documentation and knowledge sharing: Document the incident and its resolution thoroughly, sharing the lessons learned with relevant teams to improve their troubleshooting capabilities.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
1. Replace faulty disk drives in the primary database server.
2. Enhance database monitoring system to include hardware health checks.
3. Implement redundant configurations for critical database components.
4. Establish a regular maintenance schedule for hardware inspections.
5. Review and update the incident response process with clearer escalation paths.
6. Conduct a post-incident review and share the lessons learned with relevant teams.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, the company aims to minimize the occurrence of similar outages, enhance system reliability, and improve overall service availability for its users.
