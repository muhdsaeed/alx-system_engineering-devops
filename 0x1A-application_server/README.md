# Application Server

Welcome to the Application Server! This server is designed to handle the backend functionality of your application and serve as the central hub for processing requests, managing databases, and coordinating various services.

## Features

- **Request Handling**: The server efficiently handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate endpoints for processing.

- **Endpoint Management**: Define custom endpoints to expose specific functionalities of your application, allowing clients to interact with different resources and services.

- **Database Integration**: Seamlessly connect your application server to a database management system, enabling efficient data storage, retrieval, and management.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to your server and protect sensitive resources.

- **Concurrency and Scalability**: The server is designed to handle concurrent connections and can scale horizontally to accommodate increased traffic and demand.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities ensure you can track server activity, identify issues, and optimize performance.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the Application Server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/application-server.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the server settings, such as port number and database connection details, in the `config.js` file.
4. Start the server: `npm start`
5. The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port).

## API Documentation

The server exposes the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/resource`: Retrieve a specific resource.
- `POST /api/resource`: Create a new resource.
- `PUT /api/resource/:id`: Update an existing resource.
- `DELETE /api/resource/:id`: Delete a resource.

Replace `/api/resource` with the appropriate endpoint and provide the required parameters to interact with your application's resources.

## Authentication

To authenticate requests and protect your resources, the server uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Each request must include an `Authorization` header with a valid token.

To obtain a token, send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/login` with your credentials. The server will respond with a token that should be included in subsequent requests.
