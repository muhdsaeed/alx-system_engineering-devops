## FIREWALL 

A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet.

A firewall’s main purpose is to allow non-threatening traffic in and to keep dangerous traffic out.

Not only does a firewall block unwanted traffic, it can also help block malicious software from infecting your computer.

Firewalls can provide different levels of protection. The key is determining how much protection you need.

A firewall acts as a gatekeeper. It monitors attempts to gain access to your operating system and blocks unwanted traffic or unrecognized sources.

How does it do this? A firewall acts as a barrier or filter between your computer and another network such as the internet. You could think of a firewall as a traffic controller. It helps to protect your network and information by managing your network traffic. This includes blocking unsolicited incoming network traffic and validating access by assessing network traffic for anything malicious like hackers and malware.

Your operating system and your security software usually come with a pre-installed firewall. It’s a good idea to make sure those features are turned on. Also, check your security settings to be sure they are configured to run updates automatically.

History of Firewall
Network firewalls have evolved over the years to address several threats in the security landscape. Firewalls will remain crucial to organizations and society. So, let’s look at a brief history of firewalls. 

1989 - Birth of packet filtering firewalls
1992 - First commercial firewall DEC SEAL
1994 - First of the stateful firewalls appear
2004 - IDC coins the term UTM (unified threat management)
2009 - Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) was introduced by Gartner

How does a firewall work?
To start, a firewalled system analyzes network traffic based on rules. A firewall only welcomes those incoming connections that it has been configured to accept. It does this by allowing or blocking specific data packets — units of communication you send over digital networks — based on pre-established security rules.

A firewall works like a traffic guard at your computer’s entry point, or port. Only trusted sources, or IP addresses, are allowed in. IP addresses are important because they identify a computer or source, just like your postal address identifies where you live.

Types of firewalls
There are software and hardware firewalls. Each format serves a different but important purpose. A hardware firewall is physical, like a broadband router — stored between your network and gateway. A software firewall is internal — a program on your computer that works through port numbers and applications.

There also are cloud-based firewalls, known as Firewall as a Service (FaaS). One benefit of cloud-based firewalls is that they can grow with your organization and, similar to hardware firewalls, do well with perimeter security.

There are several different types of firewalls based on their structure and functionality. Here are the various firewalls you can implement, depending on the size of your network and the level of security you need

Packet-filtering firewalls

A packet-filtering firewall is a management program that can block network traffic IP protocol, an IP address, and a port number. This type of firewall is the most basic form of protection and is meant for smaller networks.

But beware. While packet-filtering firewalls can be helpful, they also have limitations. Because all web traffic is allowed, a packet-filtering firewall doesn’t block web-based attacks. So, you need additional protection to distinguish between friendly and malicious web traffic.

Proxy service firewalls

The proxy service firewall is a system that can help protect your network security by filtering messages at the application layer. It essentially serves as a gateway or middle man between your internal network and outside servers on the web. Also known as a gateway firewall, it is more secure in its use of stateful and deep packet inspection technology to analyze incoming traffic.

Stateful multi-layer inspection (SMLI) firewalls
The stateful multi-layer inspection firewall has standard firewall capabilities and keeps track of established connections. It filters traffic based on state, port, and protocol, along with administrator-defined rules and context. This involves using data from prior connections and packets from the same connection.

Most firewalls rely on stateful packet inspection to keep track of all internal traffic. This firewall is a step above packet-filtering in its use of multi-layer monitoring.

However, it is still unable to distinguish between good and bad web traffic, so you may need additional software

Unified threat management (UTM) firewalls
A unified threat management firewall is a program that combines the functions of the SMLI firewall with intrusion prevention and antivirus. Additional services like cloud management may be included under the UTM umbrella of services.

Next-generation firewalls (NGFW)
Next-generation firewalls are more sophisticated than packet-filtering and stateful inspection firewalls. Why? They have more levels of security, going beyond standard packet-filtering to inspect a packet in its entirety. That means inspecting not just the packet header, but also a packet’s contents and source. NGFW are able to block more sophisticated and evolving security threats like advanced malware.

Network address translation (NAT) firewalls
A NAT firewall is able to assess internet traffic and block unsolicited communications. In other words, it only accepts inbound web traffic if a device on your private network solicited it.

Virtual firewalls
A virtual firewall is an appliance used in a cloud-based system, both private and public. This type of firewall is used to assess and manage internet traffic over both physical and virtual networks.
